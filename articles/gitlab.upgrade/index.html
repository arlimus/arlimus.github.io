          <section class="content"><p>We’ve been happily running Gitlab for more than a year now, even though it was unmanaged and never upgraded. A few weeks ago I got my hands on it and decide to give upgrading a shot. “Can’t be that hard”. Fast-forward 3 weeks: I’m in the middle of an 1 hour automated upgrade procedure which is taking Gitlab from the stone age to the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I’ll explain how we got there and what you should consider if you’re in a similar&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>First off: Gitlab was running on a physical machine productively which I couldn’t just take down or cause service downtimes. After all, it was Christmas, and that’s not something you want to find in a giftbox. All data had to be moved and I couldn’t clone the original system since it was running on bare&nbsp;metal.</p>
<h1 id="blind-copy">Blind&nbsp;copy</h1>
<p>I wanted to see if I could recreate Gitlab 2.8 with all of my old data on a new box. It’s certainly possible, but I soon realized it’s not as easy as it looks. Copying all files and migrating MySQL data wasn’t enough, as a persistent “500 Error” quickly told me. Since the goal isn’t necessarily to upgrade Gitlab itself but only to get all the data into a new Gitlab, I decided to go a different&nbsp;route.</p>
<h1 id="bootstrapping-gitlab-6.4">Bootstrapping Gitlab&nbsp;6.4</h1>
<p>Instead of recreating Gitlab 2.8, I went for the version I wanted to end up with: Gitlab 6.4. I used <a href="https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo">knife-solo</a> for deployment and the <a href="https://github.com/ogom/cookbook-gitlab">gitlab cookbook</a>. Simply whip up a&nbsp;kitchen:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">knife</span> solo init .</code></pre></div>
<p>and configure gitlab for the destination node. It’s well described in the <a href="https://github.com/ogom/cookbook-gitlab/blob/master/README.md#usage">readme</a>. After all is done, deployment was&nbsp;easy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">knife</span> solo prepare git.mydomain.com
<span class="kw">knife</span> solo cook git.mydomain.com --no-chef-check</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="harsh-upgrade">Harsh&nbsp;upgrade</h1>
<p>So the ‘only’ issue was getting all data into shape. The brute-force way of doing this is taking all data, throwing it into Gitlab 6.4 and pressing the migrate&nbsp;button.</p>
<p>Collecting old data was&nbsp;easy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co"># get all mysql data</span>
<span class="kw">mysqldump</span> -uUSER -pPASS gitlabhq_production <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">gzip</span> <span class="kw">&gt;</span> gitlab.sql-dump.gz

<span class="co"># get all repositories and keys</span>
<span class="kw">tar</span> czf gitlab.repo-dump.tar.gz /home/git/repositories /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre></div>
<p>So was extracting it on the new&nbsp;machine:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co"># extract the repositories</span>
<span class="kw">cd</span> /
<span class="kw">tar</span> xf /root/gitlab.repo-dump.tar.gz

<span class="co"># inject the old db</span>
<span class="co"># 1. create the structure in mysql</span>
<span class="co"># 2. inject the data</span>
<span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;create database gitlabhq_production;&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">mysql</span> -u root -p<span class="ot">$MYSQL_PW</span>
<span class="kw">gunzip</span> <span class="kw">&lt;</span> /root/gitlab.sql-dump.gz <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">mysql</span> -u root -p<span class="ot">$MYSQL_PW</span> gitlabhq_production</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, how about about a <span class="caps">DB</span>&nbsp;migration?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">bundle</span> exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production</code></pre></div>
<p>Errors, as expected. After straightening out some migration sections, the core ran through, but I was greeted with the familiar “500 Error”&nbsp;again.</p>
<h1 id="chain-of-fools">Chain of&nbsp;fools</h1>
<p>Remember the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPnehDhGa14">chain of fools</a>? Upgrading Windows from caveman to to the modern-age pain in the rear we know so well? Great stuff, let’s try&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Gitlab comes with <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/tree/master/doc/update">great update instructions</a>. Since we already have the latest version, we only have to worry about whatever transforms data and ignore everything that transforms Gitlab&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>The basic steps boil down&nbsp;to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">git</span> reset --hard <span class="caps">HEAD</span>
<span class="kw">git</span> checkout -t origin/<span class="caps">XXX</span>-stable
<span class="kw">bundle</span> install
<span class="kw">...</span> do upgrade ...</code></pre></div>
<p>After some cutting, the versions I ended up stepping through were: 3.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 5.1, 5.4, 6.0, 6.2, and finally 6.4. It doesn’t just run through, however, it requries some&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The final script is found <a href="https://gist.github.com/arlimus/8365108">here</a>. The adjustments required&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older Gitlab versions need Ruby 1.9, newer need Ruby 2.0; Ruby must be adjusted during&nbsp;migration</li>
<li>Gitlab 3.1 (and older) need a configuration file to run migrations; so mock one up on the&nbsp;fly</li>
<li>Gitlab 6.0 transforms repos into a new structure; since we don’t have it running live, it will fail when trying to update the project. However, if we rescue this step, it will still correctly migrate files on the system. So a tiny patch is introduced to accomplish&nbsp;this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, even after a successful migration, I still ended up with errors. As it turns out, we were already having database inconsistencies in our old gitlab after some users were&nbsp;deleted.</p>
<p>So in addition to all these steps, I had to fix the database as well. First I had to upgrade projects whose user doesn’t exist anymore to have an&nbsp;owner:</p>
<pre class="mysql"><code># find all projects without a valid owner
select P.id from projects P left join users U on P.owner_id = U.id where U.id is null;

# set their owner to a valid id
update projects set owner_id = &quot;1&quot; where id = &quot;...&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>Without this step these repos would not have been migrated into namespaces and thus would not have been available in new&nbsp;gitlab.</p>
<p>Also, update all projects’ users to not include anyone who doesn’t exist&nbsp;anymore:</p>
<pre class="mysql"><code># find all users assigned to projects that don&#39;t exist anymore
select P.id from users_projects P left join users U on P.user_id = U.id where U.id is null

# remove these users
delete from users_projects where id = &quot;...&quot;;</code></pre>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>The final script ran for 20min backup and 30min migration. It didn’t require and intervention. We found one more bug in the deployment keys after all was done, which required a quick manual fix. All in all, very successful! Thanks to everyone working on Gitlab for making this possible&nbsp;:)</p>
